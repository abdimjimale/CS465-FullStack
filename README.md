	                                    Architecture:
1.	Frontend Development: We used a combination of technologies in the frontend of the full-stack web application. Express, HTML, and JavaScript were used to build the user interface and handle client-side interactions. Express.js, a Node.js framework, was particularly useful for routing and middleware setup. JavaScript was used to add interactivity to the web pages. On the other hand, we also implemented a Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture. SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update it as users interact with the app. This was achieved using libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js. SPAs provide a smoother user experience as they reduce page reloads.
2.	Backend Database Choice: The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database primarily for its flexibility and scalability. NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, are suitable for applications without fixed data structures, and schemas can evolve. This is beneficial in scenarios where data requirements change frequently, which is common in web applications.
                                      Functionality
1.	JSON vs. JavaScript: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data interchange format based on a subset of the JavaScript language. JSON is used to structure data in a way that is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. It serves as a common data format for communication between the frontend and backend of a web application. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language used to add interactivity to web pages.
2.	Refactoring for Efficiency: We refactored code to improve efficiency and maintainability during the development process. Reusable UI components were created to avoid duplicating code for similar features. The benefits of reusable components include code modularity, easier maintenance, and faster development of new features. These components can be used throughout the application, promoting consistency in design and functionality.
                                    Testing
1.	API Testing: API testing involves testing the various endpoints (URLs) of the backend to ensure they respond correctly to different types of requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It ensures that the API functions as expected and provides the desired data or performs the necessary actions.
2.	Security Testing: Security is crucial in a full-stack application. Security testing involves checking for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and ensuring robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Security, such as secure login authentication, must be thoroughly tested to prevent unauthorized access.
3.	Understanding Methods, Endpoints, and Security: In a full-stack application, methods (e.g., GET, POST) are HTTP request types used to interact with specific endpoints (URLs) on the server. Each endpoint corresponds to a particular functionality or resource. Security involves implementing measures like secure authentication and authorization to protect the application and its data from unauthorized access and attacks.
